                                              Internal medicine or general internal medicine (in Commonwealth nations) is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of internal diseases. Doctors specializing in internal medicine are called internists, or physicians (without a modifier) in Commonwealth nations. Internists are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. Internists care for hospitalized and ambulatory patients and may play a major role in teaching and research.
                                              Internal medicine and family medicine are often confused as equivalent in the Commonwealth nations (see below).Because internal medicine patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Internists often have subspecialty interests in diseases affecting particular organs or organ systems.

As a nodal Ministry for the advancement of women and children, the Ministry formulates plans, policies and programmes; enacts/ amends legislation, guides and coordinates the efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organisations working in the field of Women and Child Development. Besides, playing its nodal role, the Ministry implements certain innovative programmes for women and children.
 These programmes cover welfare and support services, training for employment and income generation, awareness generation and gender sensitization. 
These programmes play a supplementary and complementary role to the other general developmental programmes in the sectors of health, education, rural development etc. 
All these efforts are directed to ensure that women are empowered both economically and socially and thus become equal partners in national development along with men.

                                                              The most common specialists in the field of diabetes are endocrinologists. Endocrinologists specialize in hormonal issues and the glands that produce these hormones. Diabetes develops when the pancreas no longer produces insulin in the way it should do. The pancreas is a gland, and insulin is a hormone.
        You should go to see an endocrinologist when you're having problems controlling your diabetes. Your primary care physician may also recommend that you see a specialist for managing diabetes.
        A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes.
        A reading above 300 mg/dL can be dangerous, according to the University of Michigan, which recommends immediately informing your doctor if you have two or more readings of 300 mg/dL in a row. In severe cases, very high blood sugar levels (well above 300 mg/dL) can result in coma.

These help monitor your risk of heart and circulatory diseases and diabetes, or how your condition is being managed. Tests for different chemicals and proteins can indicate how your liver or kidneys are working.
        CBC (Complete Blood Count)</br>
        Complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered tests, and for good reason. Your blood cells can tell a lot about your health. CBC lets you and your doctor know when you have issues with infections or inflammation, but it will also signal when your diet is not balanced.
        Lab results are often shown as a set of numbers known as a reference range.        </p></div><br></br>

Besides, playing its nodal role, the Ministry implements certain innovative programmes for women and children.
 These programmes cover welfare and support services, training for employment and income generation, awareness generation and gender sensitization. 
These programmes play a supplementary and complementary role to the other general developmental programmes in the sectors of health, education, rural development etc. 
All these efforts are directed to ensure that women are empowered both economically and socially and thus become equal partners in national development along with men.

        Your doctor will press down on the skin around your belly. They'll listen for odd bowel sounds and feel for any masses or tenderness. They may ask you to take deep breaths or cough during your exam. They might also put a finger into your rectum to feel for any bulges or masses, and to check the muscle tone.
        Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain are the most common signs of a stomach virus. Although it's called the stomach flu, this virus has nothing to do with the flu. These symptoms are caused by other viruses, most commonly norovirus. 7 Fever, headache, and body aches are other possible symptoms.
